Hey! This will be my first blog I've written so please excuse if my grammar or english doesn't seem right. 

Okay, so i will be dedicating this blog to my web developement journey and software developement pitfalls, concepts I'm still trying to understand and will try to document everything as best as i can!

If you're wondering what stack I've used to build this, it's built of this framework(maybe?) Called <a href=" https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">GatsbyJS<a /> that helps me generate server side rendered websites and web apps with Reactjs on my front end, nodejs in the backend, gatsby also allows me to pull data with graphQL with minimum to no effort to set up! There's a lot of magic involved but it gets me up and running real fast without having to go through the nitty gritty details which can take possibly a month plus if i were to do it without gatsby and that is if you already aquired the right knowledge and skills.

The main reason why i choose to built it with with gatsbyJS is that is that i know a fair amount of react, no complicated deploys with databases/servers/maintenance and scaling factors. Gatsby builds the site as "static" files and could be deployed easily on any service. The perfomance i get is shockingly amazing considering the amount of time i spent(not so much) developing this.

I would like to thank the <a href=" https://syntax.fm" target="_blank">syntax<a /> podcast who have been going on about it for months and i am proud to say i have joined the hype train.
